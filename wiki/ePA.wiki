=== hf epa cnonces ===
This command collects encrypted random nonces generated by the card during the PACE protocol.
It takes two parameters. The first specifies the requested nonce length in bytes. Note that the actual length might differ from the requested (e.g. a card might return a 16-byte nonce although 17 bytes were requested). The second parameter specifies the number of nonces to be collected.
The nonces are encrypted with the card's CAN (Card Access Number).
The output is encased in two timestamps to determine the duration of the procedure.

Example:
