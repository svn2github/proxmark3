 #summary Compiling code for the PM3
<wiki:toc>
=Windows Platform=
== Setting up Subversion ==
In order to obtain the latest source code you need to check it out of the SVN repository. To do that you can use any number of free clients. This guide will show you how to use Subcommander which is a good choice for n00bs as it has a graphical interface and does not require command line access.

 * Download and install [http://subcommander.tigris.org/ Subcommander].
 * Run it and from the Bookmark menu select "new project"
 * In the Project Name field type {{{proxmark}}}, then click Next.
 * In this window, leave the fields blank, just click Next.
 * In the URL field enter {{{http://proxmark3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ }}} and click Next.
 * On the next screen, do not enter anything, just press Finish.
You're now ready to download the source code. In your Projects pane on the left, expand the proxmark tree and you should now see an entry called {{{trunk}}}. Right click on it and select {{{check out}}} from the menu. In the working copy path field type {{{C:\prox-dev\proxmark}}} then click OK and wait for the checkout to complete.

Using your file explorer, browse to C:\prox-dev\proxmark and you should see a number of subdirectories with source files in them. Rejoice!

== Setting up the compile environment ==

*Temporary breakage*: For SVN checkouts including and after revision 172 (2009-08-26 13:17:05 +0200) you need a new set of Windows tools from [http://www2.ploetzli.ch/~henryk/3fa25a104af320d0770125b4644028ec/2009.08.26.ProxSpace.zip this archive]. These will be moved to the main file repository some time soonish.

Download the 
[http://www.proxmark.org/files/index.php?dir=Sources/Windows-Compile-Environment/&download=2008.11.11.ProxSpace.zip Compile Environment] archive, you will need to create a free account at http://proxmark.org/forum in order to download files.

Extract the archive to C:\prox-dev then check that you have the following subdirectories:
 * devkitARM
 * devkitWIN
 * proxmark
If not, move the extracted directories so that they sit inside C:\prox-dev
== Compiling the code ==

Browse to the folder C:\prox-dev\proxmark\cockpit and run the file
{{{
0setpath.bat
}}}
A command window opens up.
At the prompt type
{{{
5makeall.bat
}}}
and wait for the compile to finish.
 * Check the directory C:\prox-dev\proxmark\armsrc\obj to find the files fpgaimage.s19 and osimage.s19
 * Check the directory C:\prox-dev\proxmark\bootrom\obj to find the file bootrom.s19 (was bootrom-merged.s19 before SVN revision 172)
 * Check the directory C:\prox-dev\proxmark\winsrc to find the file prox.exe
If you see these files, the compile was successful. It is *not* necessary to have the PM3 board connected via USB in order to compile the code.
== Flashing the board ==

Browse to the folder C:\prox-dev\proxmark\cockpit and run the file
{{{
0setpath.bat
}}}
A command window opens up.

===Flashing the bootloader===
*Temporary breakage*: Since SVN revision 201 (2009-09-01 16:44:38 +0200) the bootloader protocol is incompatible with old flash tools. Do not update your bootloader until a new flash tool is available for your platform. The Linux flash tool was updated in SVN revision 200. At this time, no new Windows flash tool is available. Note: Flashing a new osimage without touching the bootloader is ok, even for old bootloaders.

You only have to do this step once if you have an older or unknown firmware board. It is *not recommended* to keep reflashing the bootloader every time there's a code change *unless the change applies to the bootloader*.

Type
{{{
prox boot ..\bootrom\obj\bootrom.s19
}}}
but do not press enter yet.
Connect the USB cable to the board while hoding the button on the PM3 board down. While continuing to hold the PM3 button down, press enter on the keyboard. Only release the PM3 button when the flash operation has completed.

===Flashing the FPGA===
You only have to flash the FPGA if there has been a change in the FPGA code. This happens fairly infrequently.

Connect the PM3 board via the USB cable. Type
{{{
prox fpga ..\armsrc\obj\fpgaimage.s19
}}}
and hit enter. This will cause the board to reset. Immediately press and hold the PM3 button down. While holding the button down, re-issue the previous command. The flash process begins. When the flashing is complete, release the PM3 button.

===Flashing the ARM===
This is the code that changes most often and needs to be flashed.

Connect the PM3 board via the USB cable. Type
{{{
prox load ..\armsrc\obj\osimage.s19
}}}
and hit enter. This will cause the board to reset. Immediately press and hold the PM3 button down. While holding the button down, re-issue the previous command. The flash process begins. When the flashing is complete, release the PM3 button.
