= Introduction =

Commands related to generic ISO 14443 cards can be invoked from the "hf 14a" command subtree.

=== hf 14a list ===
This command lists all logged ISO 14443 Type A messages from either a previous communication between the Proxmark and a card or from a previous *`hf 14a snoop`* operation.

Example:
{{{
proxmark3> hf 14a list
recorded activity:          
 ETU     :rssi: who bytes          
---------+----+----+-----------          
 +      0:    :     52

}}}

=== hf 14a reader ===
This command executes the ISO 14443-3 Type A anticollision procedure and prints out the info gathered from the card's responses.

Example:
{{{
proxmark3> hf 14a reader
ATQA : 08 00          
 UID : 08 23 a3 ee 00 00 00 00 6e 39 8f 96           
 SAK : 20 [1]          
 SAK : NXP MIFARE DESFire 4k | DESFire EV1 2k/4k/8k | Plus 2k/4k | JCOP 31/41          
 ATS : 09 78 77 d4 02 00 00 90 00 90 85           
       -  TL : length is 9 bytes          
       -  T0 : TA1 is present, TB1 is present, TC1 is present, FSCI is 8          
       - TA1 : different divisors are supported, DR: [2, 4, 8], DS: [2, 4, 8]          
       - TB1 : SFGI = 0, FWI = 8          
       - TC1 : NAD is NOT supported, CID is supported          
       -  HB : 00 00 90 00           
}}}

=== hf 14a cuids ===
This essentially does nothing else than *`hf 14a reader`* except that it only prints out the card's UID and can do so an arbitrary number of times unattended. This is useful e.g. to analyze the RNG of a card that generates random UIDs. The output is encased in timestamps to indicate the duration of the complete procedure.

Example:
{{{
proxmark3> hf 14a cuids 5
Collecting 5 UIDs          
Start: 1345850802          
08F400A2          
08333494          
08B0A8B8          
085D35CE          
0862A7CB          
End: 1345850804

=== hf 14a sim ===
With this the Proxmark can emulate an ISO 14443 compliant RFID card.
_No more information available, feel free to add some_

=== hf 14a snoop ===
In this mode the Proxmark will log all traffic between RFID readers and devices in range until the hardware button is pressed. The logged traffic can then be printed with *`hf 14a list`*.
